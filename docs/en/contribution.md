# ü§ù How to Contribute

This list is not exhaustive, and it serves as a living resource that is open to continuous updates as new policies emerge, and additional countries are included. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome to ensure the repository remains relevant and useful for the broader community.  

We welcome input from researchers, policymakers, and open-source advocates. You can contribute in two ways:

You can let us know:

- The name and purpose of the policy
- Which category it belongs to
- Whether it's new or related to an existing entry
