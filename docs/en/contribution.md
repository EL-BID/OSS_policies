# ü§ù How to Contribute

This list is not exhaustive, and it serves as a living resource that is open to continuous updates as new policies emerge, and additional countries are included. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome to ensure the repository remains relevant and useful for the broader community.  

We welcome input from researchers, policymakers, and open-source advocates. You can contribute in two ways: 

**üìù Option 1‚Äì Open a Policy Suggestion**

If you know of a policy we should include or you'd like us to review something:

- Use our [Policy Suggestion Issue Template](https://github.com/EL-BID/OSS_policies/issues/new?assignees=&labels=contribution&template=policy-suggestion.yml&title=Suggestion%3A+%5BPolicy+Name%5D)

You can let us know:

- The name and purpose of the policy
- Which category it belongs to
- Whether it's new or related to an existing entry
- Any official documentation or source links

**üì• Option 2 ‚Äì Submit a Pull Request**

If you're comfortable editing Markdown and GitHub:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add or edit a policy in the correct category
3. Submit a pull request

We review all suggestions and aim to include relevant contributions quickly.

**üì¢ Share Your Experience**

In addition to contributing policy documents, we invite governments and organizations to take part in the **[Global Open-Source Policies & Practices Survey](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/opensourcesurvey)**, launched by the Digital Public Goods Alliance Secretariat together with twenty-four partner institutions. By completing the survey, you will help map the global landscape of open-source policies and practices, surface challenges, and highlight promising approaches. Your participation will enrich this repository and support the collective effort to advance open-source-first adoption worldwide
