Public entities are required to publish reusable applications‚Äîeither as products (with open-source code, documentation, licenses, and any reuse costs) or as services (with service level information)‚Äîin these directories. They are also encouraged to contribute improvements made to reused applications back to the original version, promoting a collaborative ecosystem for public sector digital solutions.
