### 🇮🇹 Italy

* 🔗 [Annex A: Guide to publishing software as open source](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/gl-acquisition-and-reuse-software-for-pa-docs/en/stabile/attachments/annex-A-Guide-to-publishing-software-as-open-source.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> This guide is aimed at administrations that, as owners of software, wish to release it in open source mode. The guide can be used by anyone responsible for carrying out the activities described therein: the internal resources of the administration, the administration’s in-house company, a service provider identified by the administration.
> The guide has also been produced in order to be annexed to technical specifications in the context of a contract; in this case the Responsible party is required to carry out the activities described in this document as an integral part of the contract, in addition to that specified in the remainder of the specifications.



### 🇰🇷 South Korea

* 🔗 [OpenUP (Open Source Support Center)](https://oss.kr/open_up_intro)
* 📄 Overview:
> A joint MSIT/NIPA initiative that provides a physical and online hub for OSS communities. OpenUP offers co-working space, mentoring, an annual “Contribution Academy” for training OSS developers, and consulting support for public-sector OSS adoption.

* 🔗 [National OSS Portal (oss.kr)](https://osasf.net/discussion/183/%EA%B3%84%EC%B2%B4...)
* 📄 Overview:
> An official web portal maintained by NIPA/MSIT with news, guides, and program information on open source software. It aggregates domestic success cases, licensing guides, security advisories, and event listings to help share OSS knowledge nationwide.



### 🇪🇸 Spain

* 🔗 [Royal Decree 4/2010 – Article 17](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2010-1331)
* 📄 Overview:
> Establishes the framework for maintaining and connecting directories of reusable applications across public administrations. The State Administration is responsible for managing the central Technology Transfer Centre (CTT), which serves as the main directory for openly reusable software. Other administrations must ensure their own directories are interoperable with the CTT and with equivalent EU platforms. Public entities are required to publish reusable applications—either as products (with open-source code, documentation, licenses, and any reuse costs) or as services (with service level information)—in these directories. They are also encouraged to contribute improvements made to reused applications back to the original version, promoting a collaborative ecosystem for public sector digital solutions.

* 🔗 [Technology Transfer Centre (CTT)](https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/pae_Home/pae_SolucionesCTT/pae_CTT_-__Que_es_.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> Spain’s Technology Transfer Centre (CTT), managed by the Ministry for Digital Transformation, is the central platform for sharing and reusing digital solutions across the public sector. It supports the implementation of the National Interoperability Framework by hosting a directory of reusable applications, promoting collaboration, cost savings, and efficiency in digital public services.
> The CTT enables administrations to publish software, documentation, licensing terms, and service details—either as downloadable products or accessible services.

The central hub, Code.gov, aggregates public code inventories from across federal agencies and provides guidance on reuse and compliance with the Federal Source Code Policy.
> Individual agencies maintain active GitHub presences, such as CMSgov (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) [github.com/CMSgov](https://github.com/CMSgov), which publishes healthcare-related digital tools; [github.com/cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov) (CISA), which shares cybersecurity frameworks and automation tools; and GSA’s open-source tools [Open.GSA.gov](https://open.gsa.gov/), which include scaffolding templates and maturity models to help standardize OSS practices. These platforms not only enable transparency and reuse but also foster collaboration within and beyond the federal government.
