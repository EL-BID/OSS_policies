### 🌍  Policies

### 🇨🇦 Canada

* 🔗 [Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Framework](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/policies-standards/government-canada-enterprise-architecture-framework.html)  
* 📄 Overview:  
> The Enterprise Architecture Framework promotes software reuse and transfer across government by requiring departments to prioritize reusable open source solutions over custom development. Under “Application Architecture” and “Business Architecture,” it encourages contributions back to OSS communities, modular system design, and the registration of reusable components in the Open Resource Exchange to facilitate adoption across departments.

### 🇬🇧 United Kingdom

* 🔗 [Open Source, Open Standards and Re‑Use: Government Action Plan)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a789aade5274a277e68e04d/open_source.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The Action Plan mandates that software developed or procured by the UK Government be reusable across the public sector, including cloud environments. As outlined in the policy section and reinforced in Action 9, government purchasers must secure full rights to custom-developed code and customisations, with the option to release them as open source when appropriate. This ensures maximum reuse and transferability of publicly funded software assets.

* 🔗 [The Digital, Data and Technology Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The playbook promotes the reuse and transfer of software among public institutions by mandating open standards and interoperable systems. The policies on "Open and interoperable data and software" and "API technical and data standards" outlined in Chapter 8 are designed to ensure that data and software components can be easily exchanged and shared across different government platforms. This strategy aims to improve efficiency, avoid redundant development efforts, and prevent vendor lock-in, thereby facilitating seamless software transfer between agencies.

### 🇪🇪 Estonia

* 🔗 [Interoperability Framework of the State Information System](https://www.stat.ee/sites/default/files/2022-11/Estonian%20IT%20Interoperability%20Framework%20-%20Abridgement%20of%20Version%203.0.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
> The "Interoperability Framework of the State Information System" encourages public sector institutions to build upon solutions and experiences from other agencies. To facilitate this, it recommends that when software is commissioned, the resulting code should be procured and registered in a repository, such as the EU's, under a free software license like the European Union Public Licence (EUPL). Furthermore, Requirement 6.5 specifies that software ordered by public institutions should be usable without restriction by other administrations, and it also suggests joint procurement for common needs. The framework even extends the principle of transfer beyond the public sector, allowing contractors to use these solutions in business activities and foreign projects, provided it does not conflict with the interests of the commissioning body.

### 🇫🇷 France

* 🔗 [Code.gouv.fr Platform](https://code.gouv.fr/presentation/)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Code.gouv.fr, maintained by DINUM, serves as a centralized platform to catalogue and share source code developed by French public administrations. Through its searchable inventory and API-accessible datasets, it facilitates the reuse and transfer of government-developed open-source software across agencies, promoting interoperability and collaborative development.

* 🔗 [Interministerial Free Software Base (SILL)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/socle-interministeriel-de-logiciels-libres/)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The SILL, maintained by DINUM and published on code.gouv.fr, is an official catalog of open-source software recommended for reuse across French public administrations. It promotes software transfer and standardization by guiding agencies toward vetted OSS solutions instead of developing redundant tools.

* 🔗 [Interministerial Support and Expertise Contracts for Free Software](https://code.gouv.fr/fr/utiliser/marches-interministeriels-support-expertise-logiciels-libres/)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The interministerial OSS support and expertise contracts, coordinated by DGFiP, promote reuse and transfer of government software by requiring that all fixes and enhancements be contributed back to the original open-source projects. This ensures that improvements made within one public agency can be shared across others, supporting collaborative maintenance and lifecycle management across the administration.

### 🇩🇪 Germany

* 🔗 [Act to Amend the Online Access Act](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/104/2010417.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
> This law promotes the reuse and transfer of government software by mandating that modifications be made public. As detailed in the justifications for the amendments to both the Online Access Act (§ 4) and the E-Government Act (§ 16a), if a public authority further develops software already in use, it is required to publish the improved source code under an open-source license. This policy ensures that enhancements to publicly funded software are shared for broader reuse and collaborative development, provided no overriding security or licensing constraints exist.

### 🇮🇹 Italy

* 🔗 [Guidelines on the acquisition and reuse of software for public administrations](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/gl-acquisition-and-reuse-software-for-pa-docs/en/stabile/index.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> As mandated by **Article 69** and elaborated in **Chapter 3**, this policy establishes a comprehensive model for the reuse and transfer of government software. Public administrations are obligated to make software they own available to other public bodies and legal entities by publishing the full source code and documentation under an open license. This process is facilitated by the **Developers Italia** platform, which serves as a central search engine for reusable solutions, thereby promoting inter-agency collaboration and preventing redundant software development efforts across the public sector.



* 🔗 [Digital Administration Code](https://docs.italia.it/italia/piano-triennale-ict/codice-amministrazione-digitale-docs/it/v2013-03-14/index.html#)
* 📄 Overview:
> This policy establishes a national framework for the mandatory reuse of government software, governed primarily by **Articles 69 and 70** of the Digital Administration Code. **Article 69** obligates public administrations to make their custom-developed software available for free to other agencies upon request, including the source code and documentation. To facilitate this, **Article 70** institutes a national database, managed by the Agency for Digital Italy (AgID), which catalogs these reusable solutions. Central public administrations are required to consult this catalog and prioritize the adoption of existing software, providing a formal justification if they opt to procure a new solution instead.


### 🇰🇷 South Korea

* 🔗 [eGovFrame (Electronic Government Standard Framework)](https://www.egovframe.go.kr/eng/sub.do?menuNo=2)
* 📄 Overview:
> eGovFrame is a government-developed, open-source software framework designed to standardize and support the reuse of software across Korean public sector IT projects. Managed by the National Information Society Agency, it provides a common infrastructure and set of reusable components that enhance interoperability, reduce redundant development, and eliminate vendor lock-in. By openly distributing source code and promoting its global use, eGovFrame operationalizes a national policy of software reuse and transfer within the public administration.
### 🇪🇸 Spain

* 🔗 [Royal Decree 4/2010 – Article 16.4](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2010-1331)
* 📄 Overview:
>Reinforces the government’s commitment to software reuse by requiring public administrations to include specific licensing provisions in contracts for the development of new digital applications. It mandates that the contracting administration must obtain full intellectual property rights over any software or information assets developed. Furthermore, if the project reuses pre-existing components, the resulting product must be eligible for reuse by other public entities. When based on open-source components, the final application should be declared open source as well—ensuring continuity of openness, legal clarity, and the potential for broader adoption within the public sector.


### 🇨🇭 Switzerland

* 🔗 [Strategic Guidelines for OSS (2019)](https://www.bk.admin.ch/dam/bk/en/dokumente/dti/themen/OSS/strategischer_leitfaden_oss_bverw.pdf.download.pdf/Em002_Strategic%20_Guidelines.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
>By using open source software, the Federal Administration contributes to priority 4, 'Strengthening digital sovereignty'. An open source solution can be reused any number of times and adapted to the individual needs of the Federal Administration due to its open source code.


### 🇺🇸 United States

* 🔗 [Federal Source Code Policy (M-16-21)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
>The U.S. Federal Source Code Policy promotes transparency, collaboration, and cost efficiency by mandating greater reuse and public release of custom-developed software across federal agencies. In line with the Digital Government Strategy’s “Shared Platform” approach, the policy encourages interagency code sharing to avoid duplicative efforts and reduce vendor lock-in. Central to the policy is a pilot program requiring agencies to release at least 20% of new custom-developed code as open source software (OSS) over three years. Agencies must inventory all custom code, ensure it is reusable government-wide, and make it discoverable via Code.gov. Open-sourcing code allows broader peer review, security testing, community-driven improvements, and more equitable vendor competition. Agencies are strongly encouraged to go beyond the 20% threshold and prioritize OSS releases that benefit both government and the public, with exceptions only in cases such as national security.
