### 🌍  Policies

### 🇨🇦 Canada

* 🔗 [Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Framework](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/policies-standards/government-canada-enterprise-architecture-framework.html)  
* 📄 Overview:  
> The Enterprise Architecture Framework promotes software reuse and transfer across government by requiring departments to prioritize reusable open source solutions over custom development. Under “Application Architecture” and “Business Architecture,” it encourages contributions back to OSS communities, modular system design, and the registration of reusable components in the Open Resource Exchange to facilitate adoption across departments.

### 🇬🇧 United Kingdom

* 🔗 [Open Source, Open Standards and Re‑Use: Government Action Plan)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a789aade5274a277e68e04d/open_source.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The Action Plan mandates that software developed or procured by the UK Government be reusable across the public sector, including cloud environments. As outlined in the policy section and reinforced in Action 9, government purchasers must secure full rights to custom-developed code and customisations, with the option to release them as open source when appropriate. This ensures maximum reuse and transferability of publicly funded software assets.

* 🔗 [The Digital, Data and Technology Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The playbook promotes the reuse and transfer of software among public institutions by mandating open standards and interoperable systems. The policies on "Open and interoperable data and software" and "API technical and data standards" outlined in Chapter 8 are designed to ensure that data and software components can be easily exchanged and shared across different government platforms. This strategy aims to improve efficiency, avoid redundant development efforts, and prevent vendor lock-in, thereby facilitating seamless software transfer between agencies.

### 🇪🇪 Estonia

* 🔗 [IT Interoperability Framework (2022 abridged)](https://www.stat.ee/sites/default/files/2022-11/Estonian%20IT%20Interoperability%20Framework%20-%20Abridgement%20of%20Version%203.0.pdf)

### 🇮🇹 Italy

* 🔗 [Section 3.1: Article 69(1), CAD](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/gl-acquisition-and-reuse-software-for-pa-docs/en/stabile/software-reuse/introduction-and-legislative-context.html#)
* 📄 Overview:
> Defines the obligation for public administrations that own software designed to the specifications of the public client, ‘to make the relevant source code available, complete with documentation and released in a public repository under an open licence, free of charge for other public administrations or legal entities that intend to adapt it to their own requirements’.
>The new wording of Article 69(2) and (2a) stresses the aim of encouraging reuse by taking steps to ensure that ‘the awarding administration shall always hold all rights to the programs and services of the information and communication technologies specifically developed for it’, ‘unless this is excessively onerous for proven technical and economic reasons’ and that ‘the source code, the documentation and the relative functional technical description of all the IT solutions are published through one or more platforms identified by AgID with its own guidelines to be adopted pursuant to Article 71’.

* 📄 Overview:
>Establishes a national “reuse database” of PA software. AgID (formerly DigitPA) evaluates and publicly catalogs PA‐developed applications suitable for reuse by other administrations, highlighting best practices. Central PAs are required to check this catalog before acquiring new software and explain if they do not adopt reusable solutions.

* 📄 Overview:
>A government-developed open-source software framework (first released 2009) that serves as the standard platform for public-sector IT projects. It is maintained by the NIA and available for anyone worldwide. By using eGovFrame, agencies reuse common components and avoid vendor lock-in, and all eGovFrame source code is publicly accessible.

### 🇪🇸 Spain

* 🔗 [Royal Decree 4/2010 – Article 16.4](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2010-1331)
* 📄 Overview:
>Reinforces the government’s commitment to software reuse by requiring public administrations to include specific licensing provisions in contracts for the development of new digital applications. It mandates that the contracting administration must obtain full intellectual property rights over any software or information assets developed. Furthermore, if the project reuses pre-existing components, the resulting product must be eligible for reuse by other public entities. When based on open-source components, the final application should be declared open source as well—ensuring continuity of openness, legal clarity, and the potential for broader adoption within the public sector.

### 🇺🇸 United States

* 🔗 [Federal Source Code Policy (M-16-21)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
>The U.S. Federal Source Code Policy promotes transparency, collaboration, and cost efficiency by mandating greater reuse and public release of custom-developed software across federal agencies. In line with the Digital Government Strategy’s “Shared Platform” approach, the policy encourages interagency code sharing to avoid duplicative efforts and reduce vendor lock-in. Central to the policy is a pilot program requiring agencies to release at least 20% of new custom-developed code as open source software (OSS) over three years. Agencies must inventory all custom code, ensure it is reusable government-wide, and make it discoverable via Code.gov. Open-sourcing code allows broader peer review, security testing, community-driven improvements, and more equitable vendor competition. Agencies are strongly encouraged to go beyond the 20% threshold and prioritize OSS releases that benefit both government and the public, with exceptions only in cases such as national security.
