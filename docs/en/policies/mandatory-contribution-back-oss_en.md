# Mandatory Contribution Back to Open-Source Projects

!!! abstract "About this policy"
      These policies encourage or require public sector institutions to give back to the open-source projects they use. By contributing bug fixes, improvements, or new features upstream, governments help strengthen the sustainability, security, and resilience of the broader open-source ecosystem‚Äîwhile also avoiding fragmentation and duplication of effort.
  
!!! note "What we include"
      This section includes strategies, legal mandates, and operational guidelines that require or strongly encourage public entities to contribute their modifications to the original open-source projects they use, rather than maintaining isolated or private forks. This includes rules on upstream collaboration, transparency, and alignment with project governance.
      
### üåç  Policies

### üá®üá¶ Canada

* üîó [Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-contributing-to-open-source-software.html)
* üìÑ Overview:
> The Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software outlines the Government of Canada's process for contributing improvements back to third-party OSS projects. It recommends that departments publish all modifications whether accepted upstream or not and ensures contributions comply with open-source licenses and community policies. Contributions can be made directly by staff or through contractors, following legal and managerial approvals. This approach supports transparency, aligns with the Digital Standards, and encourages reuse across government and the broader OSS community.

* üîó [Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Framework](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/policies-standards/government-canada-enterprise-architecture-framework.html)
* üìÑ Overview:
> The Enterprise Architecture Framework requires departments to contribute improvements back to open-source communities when using OSS, as stated under ‚ÄúApplication Architecture.‚Äù This obligation supports reuse, encourages collaboration, and ensures that enhancements developed by government are shared upstream. It also applies to customized SaaS extensions, which must be published as open source modules when feasible.

### üá´üá∑ France

* üîó [Interministerial Support and Expertise Contracts for Free Software](https://code.gouv.fr/fr/utiliser/marches-interministeriels-support-expertise-logiciels-libres/)
* üìÑ Overview:
  > The interministerial OSS support contracts coordinated by DGFiP mandate that all fixes and improvements whether for bugs, security, or compatibility be contributed back to the original open-source projects. This ensures government-funded enhancements strengthen the upstream codebase and reinforces the commons-based model of OSS development.

* üîó [Call for Comments on the State‚Äôs Open Source Contribution Policy](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/ouverture-des-codes-sources-appel-a-commentaires-sur-la-politique-de-contribution-aux-logiciels-libres-de-letat/)
* üìÑ Overview:
  > Initiated by Etalab in 2017‚Äì2018, this public consultation aimed to formalize a national policy encouraging civil servants and contractors to contribute upstream to open-source projects. Building on France‚Äôs digital republic law and later reinforced by the 2021 circulaire, the policy promotes institutional alignment with open-source norms by making contribution a standard practice for government-developed software.


### üáÆüáπ Italy

* üîó [Annex D: Guide to reusing OSS ‚Äì Code modification](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/gl-acquisition-and-reuse-software-for-pa-docs/en/stabile/attachments/annex-D-Guide-to-reusing-open-source-software.html#modification-of-the-source-code)
* üìÑ Overview:
> Italy‚Äôs open-source reuse guidelines emphasize responsible collaboration with original project maintainers when public administrations adopt or modify external open-source software. The Responsible party must propose bug fixes and new features through standard open contribution channels (e.g. pull requests, issue trackers) and aim to consolidate changes into the main codebase for broader reuse. Even when contributions are accepted upstream, the public administration must still publish its version‚Äîclearly referencing the original source‚Äîin its own code repository, in line with Article 69 of the Digital Administration Code (CAD). This ensures transparency, traceability, and reusability across the public sector.

### üá∞üá∑ South Korea

* üîó [Software Promotion Act (2020)](https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_mobile/viewer.do?hseq=62622&type=lawname&key=SOFTWARE+PROMOTION+ACT)
* üìÑ Overview:
> Beyond release requirements, the Act explicitly requires open development practices. R\&D teams must use collaborative development and make source code publicly visible.

### üá®üá≠ Switzerland

* üîó [Em002-1 Praxis-Leitfaden](https://www.bk.admin.ch/dam/bk/de/dokumente/dti/themen/OSS/praxisleitfaden-oss-bverw.pdf.download.pdf/Em002-1_Praxis_Leitfaden.pdf)
* üìÑ Overview:
> The publication obligation under EMBAG Art. 9 applies and the modifications must be released again, preferably as changes to the existing open-source project.

### üá∫üá∏ United States

* üîó [Federal Source Code Policy (2016)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
* üìÑ Overview:
> The Federal Source Code Policy introduces a key mandate around contributing back to open source by requiring U.S. federal agencies to release at least 20% of their new custom-developed code as Open Source Software (OSS) during a three-year pilot program. This policy aims to foster government-wide reuse, reduce duplication, and lower vendor lock-in‚Äîwhile also encouraging broader public benefit from taxpayer-funded software. Agencies must secure the rights to share code across the federal ecosystem and publish their code inventories on Code.gov. Although the 20% threshold is the minimum, agencies are strongly encouraged to exceed it, selecting code that could be useful to the public and open-source community. This structured approach not only promotes OSS release but also creates a feedback loop of improvement, where external contributors can enhance and reuse federal code‚Äîaligning with the government‚Äôs goals of transparency, collaboration, and innovation.

### üá™üá∫ European Commission

* üìÑ Overview:
> Public administrations should not only use open source software, but whenever possible contribute to the pertinent developer communities.
