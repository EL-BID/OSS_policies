# Mandatory Contribution Back to Open-Source Projects

!!! abstract "About this policy"
      These policies encourage or require public sector institutions to give back to the open-source projects they use. By contributing bug fixes, improvements, or new features upstream, governments help strengthen the sustainability, security, and resilience of the broader open-source ecosystem—while also avoiding fragmentation and duplication of effort.
  
!!! note "What we include"
      This section includes strategies, legal mandates, and operational guidelines that require or strongly encourage public entities to contribute their modifications to the original open-source projects they use, rather than maintaining isolated or private forks. This includes rules on upstream collaboration, transparency, and alignment with project governance.
      
### 🌍  Policies

### 🇨🇦 Canada

* 🔗 [Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-contributing-to-open-source-software.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> The Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software outlines the Government of Canada's process for contributing improvements back to third-party OSS projects. It recommends that departments publish all modifications whether accepted upstream or not and ensures contributions comply with open-source licenses and community policies. Contributions can be made directly by staff or through contractors, following legal and managerial approvals. This approach supports transparency, aligns with the Digital Standards, and encourages reuse across government and the broader OSS community.

* 🔗 [Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Framework](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/policies-standards/government-canada-enterprise-architecture-framework.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> The Enterprise Architecture Framework requires departments to contribute improvements back to open-source communities when using OSS, as stated under “Application Architecture.” This obligation supports reuse, encourages collaboration, and ensures that enhancements developed by government are shared upstream. It also applies to customized SaaS extensions, which must be published as open source modules when feasible.

### 🇫🇷 France

* 🔗 [Marchés interministériels OSS (DGFiP)](https://code.gouv.fr/fr/utiliser/marches-interministeriels-support-expertise-logiciels-libres/#:~:text=Ces%20activit%C3%A9s%20sont%20men%C3%A9es%20en,communaut%C3%A9s%20et%20les%20administrations%20b%C3%A9n%C3%A9ficiaires)
* 📄 Overview:
> Marchés interministériels OSS (DGFiP) contracts explicitly require contributors to “reverser” (push) all bug fixes and improvements back to the original OSS projects. This has been government policy since 2022, ensuring enhancements made in government-funded work return to the public commons.

* 🔗 [Politique de contribution de l’État – Etalab/DINUM](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/ouverture-des-codes-sources-appel-a-commentaires-sur-la-politique-de-contribution-aux-logiciels-libres-de-letat/#:~:text=Comment%20ouvrir%20ses%20codes%20sources%C2%A0%3F,documents%20administratifs%20communicables%20et%20r%C3%A9utilisables)
* 📄 Overview:
> Etalab’s 2018 “appel à commentaires” and subsequent policy encourage civil servants to contribute to existing open-source projects when building government software. The goal is to institutionalize upstream contributions with the 2021 circulaire setting the principle, and code.gouv guidelines formalizing it.


### 🇮🇹 Italy

* 🔗 [Annex D: Guide to reusing OSS – Code modification](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/gl-acquisition-and-reuse-software-for-pa-docs/en/stabile/attachments/annex-D-Guide-to-reusing-open-source-software.html#modification-of-the-source-code)
* 📄 Overview:
> Italy’s open-source reuse guidelines emphasize responsible collaboration with original project maintainers when public administrations adopt or modify external open-source software. The Responsible party must propose bug fixes and new features through standard open contribution channels (e.g. pull requests, issue trackers) and aim to consolidate changes into the main codebase for broader reuse. Even when contributions are accepted upstream, the public administration must still publish its version—clearly referencing the original source—in its own code repository, in line with Article 69 of the Digital Administration Code (CAD). This ensures transparency, traceability, and reusability across the public sector.

### 🇰🇷 South Korea

* 🔗 [Software Promotion Act (2020)](https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_mobile/viewer.do?hseq=62622&type=lawname&key=SOFTWARE+PROMOTION+ACT)
* 📄 Overview:
> Beyond release requirements, the Act explicitly requires open development practices. R\&D teams must use collaborative development and make source code publicly visible.

### 🇨🇭 Switzerland

* 🔗 [Em002-1 Praxis-Leitfaden](https://www.bk.admin.ch/dam/bk/de/dokumente/dti/themen/OSS/praxisleitfaden-oss-bverw.pdf.download.pdf/Em002-1_Praxis_Leitfaden.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
> The publication obligation under EMBAG Art. 9 applies and the modifications must be released again, preferably as changes to the existing open-source project.

### 🇺🇸 United States

* 🔗 [Federal Source Code Policy (2016)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
> The Federal Source Code Policy introduces a key mandate around contributing back to open source by requiring U.S. federal agencies to release at least 20% of their new custom-developed code as Open Source Software (OSS) during a three-year pilot program. This policy aims to foster government-wide reuse, reduce duplication, and lower vendor lock-in—while also encouraging broader public benefit from taxpayer-funded software. Agencies must secure the rights to share code across the federal ecosystem and publish their code inventories on Code.gov. Although the 20% threshold is the minimum, agencies are strongly encouraged to exceed it, selecting code that could be useful to the public and open-source community. This structured approach not only promotes OSS release but also creates a feedback loop of improvement, where external contributors can enhance and reuse federal code—aligning with the government’s goals of transparency, collaboration, and innovation.

### 🇪🇺 European Commission

* 🔗 [Open Source Software Strategy 2020–2023](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e59978-42c0-4b4a-9406-8f1a86837530_en?filename=en_ec_open_source_strategy_2020-2023.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
> Public administrations should not only use open source software, but whenever possible contribute to the pertinent developer communities.
