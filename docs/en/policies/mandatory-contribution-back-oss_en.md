# Mandatory Contribution Back to Open-Source Projects

!!! abstract "About this policy"
      Policies that promote the sharing and reuse of software solutions across government entities to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
  
!!! note "What we include"
      This section highlights official policies, strategies, or legal frameworks that require (or strongly encourage) public sector entities to publish software under open licenses‚Äîunless specific exceptions apply (e.g., security or third-party rights).
      
### üåç  Policies

### üá®üá¶ Canada

* üîó [Guide for contributing to OSS](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-contributing-to-open-source-software.html)
* üìÑ Overview:
> When departments use or modify open source software, they are encouraged to contribute improvements back to the original projects. This process begins by verifying the software‚Äôs license and understanding the project‚Äôs contribution policies. Departments must also ensure they have the necessary internal approvals before contributing. Contributions can be made directly by government staff or through professional services. Even if the upstream project does not accept the contribution, departments are expected to publish their changes to ensure transparency and support reuse.

* üîó [Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Framework](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/policies-standards/government-canada-enterprise-architecture-framework.html)
* üìÑ Overview:
> Application architecture includes the use of open source solutions hosted in the public cloud:
> (1) select existing solutions that can be reused over custom built;
> (2) contribute all improvements back to the communities;
> (3) register open source software to the Open Resource Exchange.
> The use software as a service (SaaS) hosted in public cloud:
> (1) choose SaaS that best fit for purpose based on alignment with SaaS capabilities;
> (2) choose a SaaS solution that is extendable;
> (3) configure SaaS and if customization is necessary extend as open source modules.
> Design for Interoperability:
> (1) design systems as highly modular and loosely coupled services;
> (2) expose services, including existing ones, through APIs;
> (3) make the APIs discoverable to the appropriate stakeholders.


### üá´üá∑ France

* üîó [March√©s interminist√©riels OSS (DGFiP)](https://code.gouv.fr/fr/utiliser/marches-interministeriels-support-expertise-logiciels-libres/#:~:text=Ces%20activit%C3%A9s%20sont%20men%C3%A9es%20en,communaut%C3%A9s%20et%20les%20administrations%20b%C3%A9n%C3%A9ficiaires)
* üìÑ Overview:
> March√©s interminist√©riels OSS (DGFiP) contracts explicitly require contributors to ‚Äúreverser‚Äù (push) all bug fixes and improvements back to the original OSS projects. This has been government policy since 2022, ensuring enhancements made in government-funded work return to the public commons.

* üîó [Politique de contribution de l‚Äô√âtat ‚Äì Etalab/DINUM](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/ouverture-des-codes-sources-appel-a-commentaires-sur-la-politique-de-contribution-aux-logiciels-libres-de-letat/#:~:text=Comment%20ouvrir%20ses%20codes%20sources%C2%A0%3F,documents%20administratifs%20communicables%20et%20r%C3%A9utilisables)
* üìÑ Overview:
> Etalab‚Äôs 2018 ‚Äúappel √† commentaires‚Äù and subsequent policy encourage civil servants to contribute to existing open-source projects when building government software. The goal is to institutionalize upstream contributions with the 2021 circulaire setting the principle, and code.gouv guidelines formalizing it.


### üáÆüáπ Italy

* üîó [Annex D: Guide to reusing OSS ‚Äì Code modification](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/gl-acquisition-and-reuse-software-for-pa-docs/en/stabile/attachments/annex-D-Guide-to-reusing-open-source-software.html#modification-of-the-source-code)
* üìÑ Overview:
> Italy‚Äôs open-source reuse guidelines emphasize responsible collaboration with original project maintainers when public administrations adopt or modify external open-source software. The Responsible party must propose bug fixes and new features through standard open contribution channels (e.g. pull requests, issue trackers) and aim to consolidate changes into the main codebase for broader reuse. Even when contributions are accepted upstream, the public administration must still publish its version‚Äîclearly referencing the original source‚Äîin its own code repository, in line with Article 69 of the Digital Administration Code (CAD). This ensures transparency, traceability, and reusability across the public sector.

### üá∞üá∑ South Korea

* üîó [Software Promotion Act (2020)](https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_mobile/viewer.do?hseq=62622&type=lawname&key=SOFTWARE+PROMOTION+ACT)
* üìÑ Overview:
> Beyond release requirements, the Act explicitly requires open development practices. R\&D teams must use collaborative development and make source code publicly visible.

* üìÑ Overview:
> The publication obligation under EMBAG Art. 9 applies and the modifications must be released again, preferably as changes to the existing open-source project.

### üá∫üá∏ United States

* üîó [Federal Source Code Policy (2016)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
* üìÑ Overview:
> The Federal Source Code Policy introduces a key mandate around contributing back to open source by requiring U.S. federal agencies to release at least 20% of their new custom-developed code as Open Source Software (OSS) during a three-year pilot program. This policy aims to foster government-wide reuse, reduce duplication, and lower vendor lock-in‚Äîwhile also encouraging broader public benefit from taxpayer-funded software. Agencies must secure the rights to share code across the federal ecosystem and publish their code inventories on Code.gov. Although the 20% threshold is the minimum, agencies are strongly encouraged to exceed it, selecting code that could be useful to the public and open-source community. This structured approach not only promotes OSS release but also creates a feedback loop of improvement, where external contributors can enhance and reuse federal code‚Äîaligning with the government‚Äôs goals of transparency, collaboration, and innovation.

### üá™üá∫ European Commission

* üîó [Open Source Software Strategy 2020‚Äì2023](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e59978-42c0-4b4a-9406-8f1a86837530_en?filename=en_ec_open_source_strategy_2020-2023.pdf)
* üìÑ Overview:
> Public administrations should not only use open source software, but whenever possible contribute to the pertinent developer communities.
