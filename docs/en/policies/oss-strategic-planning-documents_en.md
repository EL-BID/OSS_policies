* üîó [Decree No. 10.332/2020](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2020/decreto/D10332.htm)  
* üìÑ Overview:
  > Establishes the Digital Government Strategy (2020‚Äì2022) including biometric services, digital ID, secure signature mechanisms, and promotion of open and interoperable systems.DECREE No. 10,332, 2020 establishes the Digital Government Strategy for the period from 2020 to 2022, within the scope of the bodies and entities of the federal public administration, including direct, autarchic, and foundational administration, and provides other provisions. The strategy aimed to enable two million biometric validations per month for federal public services by the end of 2020, while also making digital identity broadly accessible, with a target of issuing forty million digital IDs by 2022. To support this expansion, the government committed to reducing the cost of digital certificates to no more than R$50.00 per user annually. In parallel, new digital signature mechanisms were to be made available, with an emphasis on promoting the use of highly secure digital signatures. The plan also included the establishment of criteria for adopting attribute certificates to streamline the qualification of individuals and entities. Finally, the government sought to promote the widespread use of systems and applications for verifying signature policies, ensuring they are built on open and interoperable code to foster transparency and accessibility.

### üá™üá™ Estonia

* üîó [OSS Country Intelligence Report 2025](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report%20Estonia%202025.pdf)  
* üìÑ Overview:
  > Estonia‚Äôs strategic planning documents firmly embed open-source software as a pillar of digital governance. The Digital Agenda 2030 mandates that publicly funded software be released under open-source licenses, promoting reuse and transparency. This is reinforced by the 2021 amendment to the State Property Act, which legally requires public sector software‚Äîeven if partially state-owned‚Äîto be made open source. The AI Strategy (2022‚Äì2024) furthers this by committing to the development of open-source AI components. These build on earlier foundations like the 2011 Interoperability Framework, which requires OSS to be considered in all public sector ICT procurements.

* üîó [Code.mil](https://code.mil/how-to-open-source.html)  
* üìÑ Overview:
  >The Department of Defense (DoD) integrates open source software (OSS) into its strategic planning through a structured workflow for releasing government-developed code. This workflow includes detailed legal, procedural, and technical guidance, making it a strong foundation for OSS training programs targeting federal developers and contractors. By formalizing how software should be evaluated, approved, and published, the DoD ensures that OSS contributions are secure, compliant, and reusable. These practices not only support internal policy goals like transparency and collaboration but also reinforce cross-agency interoperability and skill-building across the federal OSS ecosystem.
