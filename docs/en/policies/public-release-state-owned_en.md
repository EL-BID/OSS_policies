### 🌍  Policies

### 🇧🇷 Brazil

* 🔗 [Law Nº 14.063](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2020/lei/l14063.htm)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The information and communication systems developed exclusively by agencies and entities of the direct administration, autonomous agencies, and foundations of the constitutionally autonomous branches and bodies of the federative entities shall be governed by an open-source license, allowing their unrestricted use, copying, modification, and distribution by all agencies and entities covered by this article.
 The rule also applies retroactively to systems already in operation when the law took effect. However, exceptions include systems with restricted source code under the Access to Information Law (Law No. 12.527/2011), stored data, third-party components, and pre-existing contracts with conflicting intellectual property terms.

### 🇨🇦 Canada

* 🔗 [Guide for Publishing Open Source Code](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The Guide for Publishing Open Source Code encourages departments to release source code as open source whenever legally possible, whether developed in-house, acquired as OSS, or through contracts with proper licensing. The process includes securing approvals, ensuring rights to the code, assessing security, choosing a license and repository, adding documentation, and considering legacy systems. The overall goal is to promote transparency by working in the open.

* 🔗 [Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Framework](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/policies-standards/government-canada-enterprise-architecture-framework.html)
* 📄 Overview:
  > To support the Government of Canada’s Enterprise Ecosystem Target Architecture, application architecture must shift away from monolithic legacy systems toward modular, service-oriented designs built on reusable components. Interoperability is central to this transformation, requiring broader stakeholder coordination. Departments are encouraged to prioritize open source solutions hosted in the public cloud, selecting reusable tools over custom development, contributing improvements back to the community, and registering software in the Open Resource Exchange. When using Software as a Service (SaaS), solutions should be purpose-fit, extendable, and configured with any necessary customizations developed as open source modules. Systems should be designed for interoperability, building as loosely coupled services, exposing APIs (including for legacy systems), and ensuring those APIs are discoverable by relevant stakeholders.

### 🇪🇪 Estonia

* 🔗 [The State Property Amendment Act](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/122052021002)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The State Property Amendment Act, accepted on May 12, 2021, introduces significant updates to the State Assets Act, particularly concerning the treatment and dissemination of state-owned software. It expands the definition of movable property to include rights with proprietary value, excluding state software made freely available to the public. The Act restructures existing sections into a new Chapter 3, Division 1, and introduces Division 2, which specifically governs the provision and internal use of state software. Under the new provisions, state software—defined as computer programs with proprietary rights held wholly or partly by the state—can be made available to the public free of charge and for an unlimited duration, provided it does not pose risks to cybersecurity, public order, or national security. The decision to release such software lies with the state asset manager and must include a description and usage terms, along with a publicly accessible link to the source code. If the state only partially owns the software, it may only release the portion it owns. Additionally, the Act mandates that state software not released to the public must be shared freely among state asset managers upon request, barring security concerns, and formal agreements must outline the terms of such internal use. Finally, the amendment clarifies that these new provisions supersede certain earlier rules regarding the transfer of property and public software access.


* 🔗 [Amendments to the Estonian State Property Act](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report%20Estonia%202025.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Amendments to the Estonian State Property Act, 2021
 20: Aligning with the Digital Agenda 2030, the amendment lays out the rules for open source software development by the public sector. It specifies what information is required by the developing authorities when making software publicly available, including a description and the conditions of its use. The amendment also specifies that when only parts of the software are owned by the Estonian government, these still fall under the open source requirement. This amendment builds on the previous legislative framework, including the Interoperability Framework of the State Information System (2011) which favoured open source alternatives for the public sector but did not mandate it.

### 🇫🇷 France

* 🔗 [Loi pour une République Numérique](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000033202746)
* 📄 Overview:
  > France’s Law for a Digital Republic (Loi pour une République Numérique), enacted in 2016, establishes that software developed by public administrations constitutes administrative documents and must be made publicly available upon request. This includes source code, unless its disclosure would harm national security or other protected interests. The law effectively supports the open-sourcing of state-owned software by recognizing code as public information, promoting transparency, reuse, and citizen oversight. It has laid the foundation for several high-profile open-source releases by the French government on platforms like code.gouv.fr.

* 📄 Overview:
  >Spain’s Royal Decree 4/2010
 Regulates the National Interoperability Framework, establishes clear licensing conditions for software and digital assets developed by or for public administrations. Article 16 mandates that such resources be made available for reuse by other administrations and the public, with default licensing being free of charge and without requiring formal agreements. It aims to ensure public benefit, prevent third-party appropriation, and limit liability for the original provider. Open-source licenses must guarantee execution for any purpose, access to source code, the ability to modify, and the right to redistribute under the same terms. Public contracts must secure full intellectual property rights for the administration and ensure any new development—especially if based on open-source components—can also be declared open source and reused.

* 📄 Overview:
  >Law 40/2015, Royal Decree 4/2010, Law 37/2007
 The European Union has consistently promoted reuse as a core principle of digital government, linking it to innovation, interoperability, and efficiency. Key initiatives like the eGovernment Action Plans (2011–2015 and 2016–2020) and the Digital Decade 2030 Goals emphasize the importance of sharing solutions across public administrations. The European Interoperability Strategy (EIS) and the New European Interoperability Framework (NewEIF) further institutionalize reuse, encouraging public bodies to share software, data models, services, and specifications. These recommendations are backed by Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on the reuse of public sector information. In Spain, this vision is reflected in national laws and regulations, including Law 40/2015, Royal Decree 4/2010, Law 37/2007, and its implementing decrees. To support implementation, Spain has published specific guides and technical standards, such as the NTI-RISP and its application guide, reinforcing reuse as a legal and operational priority in digital administration.

### 🇨🇭 Switzerland

* 📄 Overview:
  >Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means to Carry Out Official Tasks (EMOTA)
 Following the introduction of the Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means to Carry Out Official Tasks (EMOTA), the Federal Administration is now disclosing the source code of its software as open source. Article 9 EMOTA states that anyone should be able to use, improve and distribute the relevant software free of charge. The Federal Chancellery's Digital Transformation and ICT Steering Sector has created a set of tools to assist federal authorities and interested third parties. Each federal authority is responsible for its implementation of the open source requirement, i.e. publishing the source code.

* 📄 Overview:
  >Em002 Strategic Guidelines for Open Source Software in the Federal Administration 
 When developing software, open source release is generally mandatory, subject to the exceptions set out in Art. 9 EMOTA (third‑party rights and security‑relevant reasons). These exceptions are addressed in Em002‑2 Instructions for Publishing OSS

* 🔗 [Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS](https://www.bk.admin.ch/dam/bk/en/dokumente/dti/themen/OSS/strategischer_leitfaden_oss_bverw.pdf.download.pdf/Em002_Strategic%20_Guidelines.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  >Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS
 Focuses on operationalizing the publication and use of open-source software (OSS) within public administration. It mandates the implementation of the Instructions for Publishing OSS, including practical tools like checklists, licensing guidance, and templates such as the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). These resources are designed to support administrative units throughout the software lifecycle—especially when modifying or releasing OSS—by ensuring legal compliance and transparency. The measure also addresses the reuse of legacy code under Article 9 of EMOTA, promoting pragmatic approaches for integration. To streamline adoption, the Confederation’s project management methodology (HERMES) is being updated to embed these tools, allowing public bodies to apply OSS practices through established workflows.

* 🔗 [The Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Administrative Deployments](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/digitale-transformation-ikt-lenkung/bundesarchitektur/open_source_software.html)
* 📄 Overview:
  >The Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Administrative Deployments (EMBAG) 
 Mandates that the federal administration publish its software as open source, in line with Article 9, which ensures free access and reuse. Each federal authority is responsible for implementing this requirement and may choose its own platform for publication. The strategic guide outlines objectives and distinguishes between using existing OSS (treated equally with proprietary software) and creating new software, where EMBAG Article 9 applies. The practical guide supports implementation by providing definitions, benefits, challenges, licensing information, and procurement guidance, and is designed to be accessible even to those without prior experience. In 2025, open source is also a priority under the Federal Council’s Digital Switzerland Strategy.

### 🇺🇸 United States

* 🔗 [Federal Source Code Policy and State Property Act](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  >Federal Source Code Policy and State Property Act 
 Together they promote a shift toward openness, transparency, and efficiency in U.S. federal software development. The State Property Act establishes that state-owned software must be made public unless there are security concerns, reinforcing the principle that publicly funded digital assets should be accessible to the public. Building on this, the Federal Source Code Policy mandates that federal agencies enhance the reuse of custom-developed code across government to reduce duplication, lower costs, and avoid vendor lock-in. It introduces a pilot program requiring agencies to release at least 20 percent of their newly commissioned custom software as open source for three years, encouraging broader public access and collaboration. This approach aligns with the Digital Government Strategy’s “Shared Platform” model, which promotes inter-agency cooperation and standardization. Agencies are also required to maintain a comprehensive inventory of all custom-developed code and make it discoverable through platforms like Code.gov, ensuring that software assets are reusable across the federal government. The policy emphasizes that releasing code as open source not only improves transparency and public trust but also enhances software quality through peer review, facilitates security testing, and allows vendors to compete more effectively for future work. By encouraging agencies to release as much code as possible (beyond the 20 percent minimum), the policy aims to foster a culture of openness, innovation, and continuous improvement in federal digital services.
