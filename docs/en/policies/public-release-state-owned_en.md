This approach is intended to increase transparency, allow for the reuse of software components, and reduce the overall cost of digital services. As detailed in the "Open and interoperable data and software" policy within Chapter 8, new government software is expected to be developed openly and published under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative.

### 🇪🇪 Estonia

* 🔗 [Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030](https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/documents/2022-04/Digi%C3%BChiskonna%20arengukava_ENG.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Within the "Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030," the policy for releasing state-owned software is articulated as a key result under Sub-objective I, "Digital government," specifically in the section on "Open innovation and development of govtech community." The agenda mandates that software developed for the government with public funds and containing public sector intellectual property must be published with an open source license. This rule is exempted only when the software is significant for national security. To support this initiative and encourage a robust "govtech" community, the plan also includes activities to adopt and develop tools for reuse and collaboration, such as a code repository and artifactory.


* 🔗 [State Property Amendment Act](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/122052021002)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The *State Property Amendment Act* establishes that state-owned software in Estonia can be released publicly, free of charge and indefinitely, unless it poses risks to cybersecurity, public order, or national security. As outlined in Chapter III, Division 2, asset managers must publish the source code with usage terms online, and unreleased software must still be shared freely among government entities upon request.

* 📄 Overview:
  >Spain’s Royal Decree 4/2010
 Regulates the National Interoperability Framework, establishes clear licensing conditions for software and digital assets developed by or for public administrations. Article 16 mandates that such resources be made available for reuse by other administrations and the public, with default licensing being free of charge and without requiring formal agreements. It aims to ensure public benefit, prevent third-party appropriation, and limit liability for the original provider. Open-source licenses must guarantee execution for any purpose, access to source code, the ability to modify, and the right to redistribute under the same terms. Public contracts must secure full intellectual property rights for the administration and ensure any new development—especially if based on open-source components—can also be declared open source and reused.

* 📄 Overview:
  >Law 40/2015, Royal Decree 4/2010, Law 37/2007
 The European Union has consistently promoted reuse as a core principle of digital government, linking it to innovation, interoperability, and efficiency. Key initiatives like the eGovernment Action Plans (2011–2015 and 2016–2020) and the Digital Decade 2030 Goals emphasize the importance of sharing solutions across public administrations. The European Interoperability Strategy (EIS) and the New European Interoperability Framework (NewEIF) further institutionalize reuse, encouraging public bodies to share software, data models, services, and specifications. These recommendations are backed by Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on the reuse of public sector information. In Spain, this vision is reflected in national laws and regulations, including Law 40/2015, Royal Decree 4/2010, Law 37/2007, and its implementing decrees. To support implementation, Spain has published specific guides and technical standards, such as the NTI-RISP and its application guide, reinforcing reuse as a legal and operational priority in digital administration.

* 📄 Overview:
  >Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS
 Focuses on operationalizing the publication and use of open-source software (OSS) within public administration. It mandates the implementation of the Instructions for Publishing OSS, including practical tools like checklists, licensing guidance, and templates such as the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). These resources are designed to support administrative units throughout the software lifecycle—especially when modifying or releasing OSS—by ensuring legal compliance and transparency. The measure also addresses the reuse of legacy code under Article 9 of EMOTA, promoting pragmatic approaches for integration. To streamline adoption, the Confederation’s project management methodology (HERMES) is being updated to embed these tools, allowing public bodies to apply OSS practices through established workflows.

* 🔗 [The Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Administrative Deployments](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/digitale-transformation-ikt-lenkung/bundesarchitektur/open_source_software.html)
* 📄 Overview:
  >The Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Administrative Deployments (EMBAG) 
 Mandates that the federal administration publish its software as open source, in line with Article 9, which ensures free access and reuse. Each federal authority is responsible for implementing this requirement and may choose its own platform for publication. The strategic guide outlines objectives and distinguishes between using existing OSS (treated equally with proprietary software) and creating new software, where EMBAG Article 9 applies. The practical guide supports implementation by providing definitions, benefits, challenges, licensing information, and procurement guidance, and is designed to be accessible even to those without prior experience. In 2025, open source is also a priority under the Federal Council’s Digital Switzerland Strategy.

### 🇺🇸 United States

* 🔗 [Federal Source Code Policy and State Property Act](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  >Federal Source Code Policy and State Property Act 
 Together they promote a shift toward openness, transparency, and efficiency in U.S. federal software development. The State Property Act establishes that state-owned software must be made public unless there are security concerns, reinforcing the principle that publicly funded digital assets should be accessible to the public. Building on this, the Federal Source Code Policy mandates that federal agencies enhance the reuse of custom-developed code across government to reduce duplication, lower costs, and avoid vendor lock-in. It introduces a pilot program requiring agencies to release at least 20 percent of their newly commissioned custom software as open source for three years, encouraging broader public access and collaboration. This approach aligns with the Digital Government Strategy’s “Shared Platform” model, which promotes inter-agency cooperation and standardization. Agencies are also required to maintain a comprehensive inventory of all custom-developed code and make it discoverable through platforms like Code.gov, ensuring that software assets are reusable across the federal government. The policy emphasizes that releasing code as open source not only improves transparency and public trust but also enhances software quality through peer review, facilitates security testing, and allows vendors to compete more effectively for future work. By encouraging agencies to release as much code as possible (beyond the 20 percent minimum), the policy aims to foster a culture of openness, innovation, and continuous improvement in federal digital services.
