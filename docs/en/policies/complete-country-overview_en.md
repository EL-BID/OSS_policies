Plays like "Choose a modern technology stack" (Play 8) and "Default to open" (Play 13) make the consideration and publication of OSS a core part of the official strategy for effective and modern government IT development. |
| OSS in Strategic Planning Documents | [Federal Source Code Policy (M-16-21)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf) | This memorandum is a foundational strategic document that fulfills a U.S. Open Government National Action Plan commitment. It establishes a government-wide framework for software development that institutionalizes the principles of code reuse and open source. By setting clear objectives and requirements, it embeds OSS as a key component of federal IT strategy and management. |
| OSS in Strategic Planning Documents | [Securing Open Source Software Act of 2023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3286/text) | This Act embeds open source security directly into the Homeland Security Act of 2002, a foundational national security law. By assigning permanent duties to the Director of CISA in Section 2220F, it elevates the security of the OSS ecosystem from a best practice to a core, strategic responsibility of the U.S. government's cybersecurity mission. |
