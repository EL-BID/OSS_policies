### üá™üá™ Estonia

| OSS Policy Type | üìÑ Document | üìÑ Overview |
|---|---|---|
| Public Release of State-Owned Software | [Estonia‚Äôs Digital Agenda 2030](https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/documents/2022-04/Digi%C3%BChiskonna%20arengukava_ENG.pdf) | Within the "Estonia‚Äôs Digital Agenda 2030," the policy for releasing state-owned software is articulated as a key result under Sub-objective I, "Digital government," specifically in the section on "Open innovation and development of govtech community." The agenda mandates that software developed for the government with public funds and containing public sector intellectual property must be published with an open source license. This rule is exempted only when the software is significant for national security. To support this initiative and encourage a robust "govtech" community, the plan also includes activities to adopt and develop tools for reuse and collaboration, such as a code repository and artifactory. |
| Public Release of State-Owned Software | [State Property Amendment Act](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/122052021002) | The *State Property Amendment Act* establishes that state-owned software in Estonia can be released publicly, free of charge and indefinitely, unless it poses risks to cybersecurity, public order, or national security. As outlined in Chapter III, Division 2 (281‚Äì284), asset managers must publish the source code with usage terms online, and unreleased software must still be shared freely among government entities upon request. |
| Prioritize Open Source in Procurement | [Interoperability Framework of the State Information System](https://www.stat.ee/sites/default/files/2022-11/Estonian%20IT%20Interoperability%20Framework%20-%20Abridgement%20of%20Version%203.0.pdf) | In the "Interoperability Framework of the State Information System," the policy to prioritize open source software in public procurement is detailed across several sections, including "Openness" (2.9), "Technology neutrality" (2.11), and most explicitly in Chapter 6, "Software and open specifications." The framework mandates that public sector institutions must consider open source software alternatives when procuring or developing any new system. More specifically, Requirement 6.1 states a clear preference for software with an accessible source code when other conditions of the procurement are equal. This policy is part of a broader strategy to ensure openness and avoid vendor lock-in, implying that any decision to select a proprietary solution should be well-justified against suitable open source options. |
| Prioritize Open Source in Procurement  | [The Estonian IT Interoperability Framework](https://www.forumstandaardisatie.nl/sites/default/files/FS/2011/0207/FS-20110207.02C-The-Estonian-IT-Interoperability-Framework.pdf) | Central and local government agencies are required to follow a set of principles when using open source software (OSS). In the development of information systems and procurement processes, OSS-based solutions must be evaluated alongside proprietary alternatives. While decisions can favor OSS, commercial software, or a hybrid of both, OSS holds a unique advantage: when requirements are otherwise equal, OSS acquired by one public agency can be freely used and adapted by others‚Äîunlike standard proprietary software, which remains under the control of its producer. Collaborative procurement should be prioritized when multiple agencies share similar needs, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, in joint projects or commonly used systems, only products that support open standards and specifications should be employed to ensure interoperability. Agencies must avoid becoming dependent on vendor-specific products and services. When acquiring IT solutions, the procurement should include access to the software‚Äôs source code or, in the case of commercial products, any custom adaptations. Where feasible, this principle should be applied to ensure transparency, flexibility, and long-term sustainability in public sector digital infrastructure. |
| Reuse and Transfer of Government Software | [Interoperability Framework of the State Information System](https://www.stat.ee/sites/default/files/2022-11/Estonian%20IT%20Interoperability%20Framework%20-%20Abridgement%20of%20Version%203.0.pdf) | The "Interoperability Framework of the State Information System" encourages public sector institutions to build upon solutions and experiences from other agencies. To facilitate this, it recommends that when software is commissioned, the resulting code should be procured and registered in a repository, such as the EU's, under a free software license like the European Union Public Licence (EUPL). Furthermore, Requirement 6.5 specifies that software ordered by public institutions should be usable without restriction by other administrations, and it also suggests joint procurement for common needs. The framework even extends the principle of transfer beyond the public sector, allowing contractors to use these solutions in business activities and foreign projects, provided it does not conflict with the interests of the commissioning body. |
| Open Source Sharing Platforms | [Koodivaramu Open Source Platform](https://koodivaramu.eesti.ee/explore) | Estonia‚Äôs *Koodivaramu* platform serves as a centralized repository for sharing government-developed open-source software. Managed by the Information System Authority (RIA), it facilitates collaboration among public sector institutions by hosting and documenting reusable software components, primarily through GitLab. The platform promotes transparency, reuse, and co-development across agencies, aligning with Estonia‚Äôs broader digital governance and interoperability goals. |
| Open Standards Requirement | [Estonia‚Äôs Digital Agenda 2030](https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/documents/2022-04/Digi%C3%BChiskonna%20arengukava_ENG.pdf) | Estonia‚Äôs Digital Agenda 2030 establishes its open standards policy as a core tenet for all digital development. In the "Principles" section, the agenda outlines a technology-neutral approach that, whenever possible, gives preference to open standards and solutions built upon them. This guiding principle aims to ensure interoperability and openness in government systems. The commitment is reinforced by planned activities elsewhere in the document, such as ensuring the compatibility of the digital government with the European interoperability framework, a goal mentioned in the section on "Future-proof digital government platforms," and promoting cross-border interoperability through international cooperation. |
| Open Standards Requirement | [Interoperability Framework of the State Information System](https://www.stat.ee/sites/default/files/2022-11/Estonian%20IT%20Interoperability%20Framework%20-%20Abridgement%20of%20Version%203.0.pdf) | The "Interoperability Framework of the State Information System" establishes a mandate for using open standards to ensure technical interoperability and openness across the public sector. This policy is detailed in Chapter 5 ("Open standards") and supported by principles in sections 2.9 ("Openness") and 2.11 ("Technology neutrality"). The framework requires that public sector system interfaces must be created in a technology-neutral manner using prescribed open standards like XML, WSDL, and SOAP. A core component of this policy, outlined in Chapter 5, is the compulsory adherence to an agreed minimum set of open standards for public administration. Furthermore, Requirement 2.33 mandates that any decision to use closed standards or specifications must be explicitly justified, reinforcing the preference for open solutions. |
| Licensing Frameworks and Guidelines | [Interoperability Framework of the State Information System](https://www.stat.ee/sites/default/files/2022-11/Estonian%20IT%20Interoperability%20Framework%20-%20Abridgement%20of%20Version%203.0.pdf) | The "Interoperability Framework of the State Information System" provides specific guidelines on licensing practices for software developed or procured by the Estonian public sector. The central policy, found in Requirement 2.37 under the principle of "Reusability," directs public institutions to use the European Union Public Licence (EUPL) when creating and releasing free software. This guidance is reinforced in Chapter 6, which recommends that custom software code procured by the government also be registered in a repository under a free software license, again citing the EUPL as the example. The framework further advises that procurement contracts should ensure the resulting software is usable without restriction across other public administration institutions, thereby establishing a clear preference for licenses that permit broad inter-agency sharing and reuse. |

This is most explicitly detailed under Sub-objective I, "Digital government," where a key result is the public release of state-owned software. The agenda specifies that software developed for the digital government using taxpayer funds and public sector intellectual property will be published under an open source license, provided it does not compromise national security. This core policy, located in the section on "Open innovation and development of govtech community," is supported by planned activities such as establishing a central code repository to promote the reuse of digital solutions. |
