### 🌍  Policies

### 🇨🇦 Canada

* 🔗 [Address Security and Privacy Risks Guideline](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards/address-security-privacy-risks.html)  
* 📄 Overview:  
> The Address Security and Privacy Risks guideline provides a comprehensive framework for securing software, including OSS used in government systems. It outlines security measures across the full lifecycle, including threat modeling, automated and penetration testing, privacy impact assessments, encryption, and patch management. While not exclusive to OSS, the guidance supports open-source adoption by emphasizing transparency, modular security features, and continuous monitoring, helping ensure that open systems meet rigorous privacy and cybersecurity standards.

* 🔗 [Open First Whitepaper: Open Source Software Use](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/open-first-whitepaper/open-first-whitepaper-use.html)  
* 📄 Overview:  
> The Open First Whitepaper emphasizes security as a key advantage of open-source software, citing its transparency, auditability, and wide peer review. In the "Security" section, the document explains that public access to source code allows for early identification and remediation of vulnerabilities, aligning with NIST recommendations against relying on obscurity. OSS is favored by national security agencies due to its inspectability, and its security model based on hardening through open testing, is presented as more robust when projects are actively maintained and reviewed.



### 🇪🇨 Ecuador

* 🔗 [Executive Decree No. 1014](https://web.gestiondocumental.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Decreto-Ejecutivo-N-1014.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Executive Decree No. 1014 requires Ecuador’s central government entities to ensure technical capacity before deploying open-source software, as stated in Article 3. This provision aims to safeguard the secure and effective implementation of OSS by mandating adequate support infrastructure, indirectly addressing OSS security through operational readiness and oversight by the Subsecretariat of Informatics.
  
### 🇬🇧 England

* 🔗 [Open Source, Open Standards and Re‑Use: Government Action Plan)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a789aade5274a277e68e04d/open_source.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The Action Plan addresses open source security through Action 4, which establishes regular assessments by the CIO Council to ensure that open-source products used in government meet defined standards of maturity, codebase security, and project sustainability. This measure aims to mitigate risks associated with deploying open-source solutions in critical public services by verifying the reliability and stability of the tools before widespread adoption.

* 🔗 [The Digital, Data and Technology Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The playbook defines security protocols for all procured technology, which inherently covers open source software. The "Cyber security assessment" key policy requires that all projects apply a robust level of security assessment to safeguard public data. As expanded upon in Chapters 8 and 9, this includes mandating standards such as the Cyber Essentials Scheme for contracts handling personal information or providing certain ICT services, ensuring that any OSS utilized in public systems is subject to the same rigorous security risk evaluation and management.

### 🇫🇷 France

* 🔗 [Interministerial Support and Expertise Contracts for Free Software](https://code.gouv.fr/fr/utiliser/marches-interministeriels-support-expertise-logiciels-libres/)

This policy ensures that vulnerabilities addressed within public systems are resolved at the source, enhancing security for both government and broader OSS users.

* 🔗 [Selecting Open Source Software – ANSSI Guide](https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/selection-dun-logiciel-libre)
* 📄 Overview:
  > ANSSI’s guide “Sélection d’un logiciel libre” outlines cybersecurity criteria for evaluating and selecting open-source software used in public systems. While not binding, it promotes secure OSS adoption by recommending assessment of code transparency, maintenance practices, and community responsiveness, reinforcing France’s broader open-source security posture.

* 🔗 [Reporting Significant Vulnerabilities](https://cert.ssi.gouv.fr/signalement-vulnerabilite-incident-2321-4-1)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Under Article L. 2321‑4‑1 of the French Code de la Défense, all software publishers—including open-source developers—are required to report significant vulnerabilities or incidents affecting their products to ANSSI. This regulation ensures security issues in OSS are disclosed and addressed promptly, reinforcing national cybersecurity standards across both proprietary and open systems.
