### 🌍  Policies

### 🇨🇦 Canada

* 🔗 [Guide for Publishing Open Source Code](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> The Guide for Publishing Open Source Code outlines licensing best practices for government OSS projects, recommending permissive (MIT, Apache 2.0) or reciprocal (GPL, LGPL, AGPL) licenses based on project needs. It advises selecting licenses aligned with community norms and ensuring compatibility with third-party components to enable compliant and effective open-source release.

* 🔗 [Open Source Software Form](https://code.open.canada.ca/en/open-source-software-form.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> The Open Source Software Form provides guidance for Canadian public administrations to register OSS projects along with their licensing information using standardized SPDX identifiers. By requiring submission of license details including short identifiers, URLs, and license levels, this process promotes consistency and legal clarity in how open-source software is shared and reused across jurisdictions. The use of SPDX ensures alignment with internationally recognized licensing practices for software, data, and related assets.

### 🇬🇧 England

* 🔗 [Service Manual: Making Source Code Open and Reusable)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusabley)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The Service Manual provides clear licensing guidance, advising UK government teams to release code under an Open Source Initiative (OSI)-approved license, such as MIT. The "Licensing your code" section emphasizes legal clarity around reuse, default Crown Copyright, and the need for open licensing when publishing government-developed software, ensuring compliance and encouraging responsible sharing of public code.

* 🔗 [The Digital, Data and Technology Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The playbook provides clear guidance on software licensing by establishing a framework for intellectual property (IP) and the use of open source licenses. The section on "Open software" in Chapter 8 specifies that government-developed code should be published using an Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license. Furthermore, the chapter's detailed discussion on IP ownership presents various models for consideration, guiding agencies on how to manage IP rights to maximize long-term value and enable the publication of government-funded work as open source material.

### 🇪🇪 Estonia

* 🔗 [Interoperability Framework of the State Information System](https://www.stat.ee/sites/default/files/2022-11/Estonian%20IT%20Interoperability%20Framework%20-%20Abridgement%20of%20Version%203.0.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
> The "Interoperability Framework of the State Information System" provides specific guidelines on licensing practices for software developed or procured by the Estonian public sector. The central policy, found in Requirement 2.37 under the principle of "Reusability," directs public institutions to use the European Union Public Licence (EUPL) when creating and releasing free software. This guidance is reinforced in Chapter 6, which recommends that custom software code procured by the government also be registered in a repository under a free software license, again citing the EUPL as the example. The framework further advises that procurement contracts should ensure the resulting software is usable without restriction across other public administration institutions, thereby establishing a clear preference for licenses that permit broad inter-agency sharing and reuse.

### 🇫🇷 France

* 🔗 [Legal Guide for Open Source Software – Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/accompagnement-logiciels-libres/)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Etalab’s legal guide supports public agents in navigating open-source licensing by clarifying which licenses are recommended, how to manage compatibility and patent clauses, and how to draft OSS-friendly contractual clauses. It also offers guidance for including OSS in public procurement and for releasing code under approved licenses from the first commit.

* 🔗 [Decree No. 2017-638 of April 27, 2017](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/article_jo/JORFARTI000034502563)
* 📄 Overview:
  > This decree establishes the list of approved open-source licenses that French public administrations may use for releasing software. It officially authorizes several permissive and reciprocal licenses including Apache 2.0, BSD, MIT, MPL 2.0, GPLv3, and CeCILL and sets a process for requesting approval of alternative licenses through the Interministerial Directorate for State IT Systems.


### 🇩🇪 Germany

* 🔗 [openCoDE – Licensing Rules (2023)](https://opencode.de/en/about-opencode)
* 📄 Overview:
> The openCoDE platform requires that all published projects use licenses meeting the Open Source Initiative’s criteria. Automated checks ensure that any code submitted to openCoDE is under an OSI-approved open-source license.

### 🇮🇹 Italy

* 🔗 [Guide to open licences and selecting a licence](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/gl-acquisition-and-reuse-software-for-pa-docs/en/stabile/software-reuse/open-licences-and-selecting-a-licence.html#choosing-a-licence)
* 📄 Overview:
> To streamline licence selection, administrations are advised to reuse the original licence when modifying existing open source software to ensure interoperability. For new software, the default recommendation is the EUPL v1.2 licence, chosen for its European-level compatibility and copyleft protections. Exceptions include the AGPL-3.0-or-later for web-based software, the BSD 3-Clause licence for widely used components like libraries and SDKs, and the CC-BY 4.0 licence for technical documentation. These licences are selected to maximize reuse and compatibility. Any deviation from these recommendations must be justified, ensuring that alternative choices do not hinder reuse or increase costs.



### 🇰🇷 South Korea

* 🔗 [Open Source Software License Guide (NIPA, 2024)](https://www.oss.kr/oss_guide/show/9a73fa3c-c233-4e8b-8527-7d57ed7218f7#:~:text=,%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%EA%B3%BC%20%EC%B6%9C%EC%8B%9C%EA%B0%80%20%EC%A6%9D%EA%B0%80%ED%95%A8%EC%97%90%20%EB%94%B0%EB%9D%BC%20%EC%98%A4%ED%94%88%EC%86%8C%EC%8A%A4SW)
* 📄 Overview:
> NIPA’s official guidebook (updated Jan 2024) detailing how organizations must comply with open-source licenses. It explains license obligations for using and distributing OSS, and includes checklists for major licenses.

### 🇪🇸 Spain

* 🔗 [Royal Decree 4/2010 – Article 16](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2010-1331)
* 📄 Overview:
> Sets out the licensing framework for public sector software and digital assets, emphasizing reuse, openness, and legal clarity. Public administrations must license their software—by default, free of charge and without requiring formal agreements—to maximize the reuse of public resources while protecting against exclusive appropriation and limiting liability.
> When software is declared open source, licenses must ensure the four fundamental freedoms: to use, study, modify, and redistribute the software. The EU Public License (EUPL) is recommended, though equivalent licenses may also be used. Additionally, when contracting new software development, public bodies must secure full intellectual property rights and ensure the resulting application can be offered for reuse, especially if based on pre-existing or open-source components. This legal structure enables transparent sharing and sustainable development of public digital solutions.

### 🇨🇭 Switzerland

* 🔗 [Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/en/home/digitale-transformation-ikt-lenkung/bundesarchitektur/open_source_software/hilfsmittel_oss.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> In the case of open source, licences that comply with OSI are usually used. If software is under a licence with a copyleft provision, any modification or extension of the source code must be released again under the licence of the modified open source software.

### 🇺🇸 United States

* 🔗 [CISA Open Source Policy (GitHub)](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/blob/develop/open-source-policy/policy.md)
* 📄 Overview:
> CISA’s default approach to open source licensing places its projects in the U.S. public domain, using the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to waive copyright internationally. Contributors are informed—via the default CONTRIBUTING file—that their contributions will be licensed under the same terms. However, when projects incorporate third-party open source components, they may be subject to additional licenses with specific terms governing use, modification, and redistribution. As a result, individual CISA projects may need to adjust their LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING files to reflect these external obligations, ensuring compliance and clarity for both contributors and users.

### 🇪🇺 European Commission

* 🔗 [Open Source Software Strategy 2020–2023](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e59978-42c0-4b4a-9406-8f1a86837530_en?filename=en_ec_open_source_strategy_2020-2023.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
> For publication of these projects, the European Union public licence (EUPL) will be preferred.
