* 📄 Overview:
> The "Interoperability Framework of the State Information System" establishes a mandate for using open standards to ensure technical interoperability and openness across the public sector. This policy is detailed in Chapter 5 ("Open standards") and supported by principles in sections 2.9 ("Openness") and 2.11 ("Technology neutrality"). The framework requires that public sector system interfaces must be created in a technology-neutral manner using prescribed open standards like XML, WSDL, and SOAP. A core component of this policy, outlined in Chapter 5, is the compulsory adherence to an agreed minimum set of open standards for public administration. Furthermore, Requirement 2.33 mandates that any decision to use closed standards or specifications must be explicitly justified, reinforcing the preference for open solutions.
