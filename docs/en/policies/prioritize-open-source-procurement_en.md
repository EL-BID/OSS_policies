# Prioritize Open Source in Procurement

!!! abstract "About this policy"
      Procurement policies that prioritize or favor open-source software help governments avoid vendor lock-in, reduce long-term costs, and strengthen digital sovereignty. These rules ensure public money supports reusable and adaptable digital infrastructure.
  
!!! note "What we include"
      This section highlights official laws, frameworks, and procurement guidelines that give preference to OSS in public tenders or acquisitions by establishing it as the default option, requiring justification when choosing proprietary software, or including OSS among prioritized alternatives during comparative evaluations.
      
### 🌍  Policies

### 🇧🇷 Brazil

* 🔗 [Law Nº 14.063/2020](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2020/lei/l14063.htm)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Article 16 of Law Nº 14.063/2020 requires public entities to release software they develop under open-source licenses, allowing reuse and modification. This applies retroactively, with exceptions for legal, security, or contractual restrictions.

### 🇨🇦 Canada

* 🔗 [Acquiring Open Source Software Guidance](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/acquiring-open-source-software.html)  
* 📄 Overview:  
> The Acquiring Open Source Software guidance establishes a preference for OSS in procurement, as outlined in Appendix C of the Directive on Management of IT. Departments are encouraged to select OSS where feasible, provided business needs justify its use. If OSS is freely available and meets requirements, it may be acquired without a formal tender. However, procurement must remain compliant with existing legal frameworks, and any non-standard contract terms require prior authorization.

### 🇪🇨 Ecuador

* 🔗 [Organic Code of the Social Economy of Knowledge, Creativity, and Innovation](https://www.gobiernoelectronico.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Codigo-Organico-de-la-Economia-Social-de-los-Conocimientos-Creatividad-e-Innovacion.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > According to Article 148, public entities must follow a strict order of preference when procuring software. This hierarchy prioritizes open-source software, particularly solutions that include significant locally-added value through development or implementation services. If a public body cannot acquire software that meets this top criterion, it is required to formally justify the acquisition of any other type of technology before the national e-government regulatory authority, which will evaluate the decision based on factors such as sustainability, security, and cost.

* 🔗 [Executive Decree No. 1014](https://web.gestiondocumental.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Decreto-Ejecutivo-N-1014.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Executive Decree No. 1014 establishes that entities within Ecuador’s Central Public Administration must prioritize free and open-source software in procurement processes. As outlined in Article 1 and Article 5, open-source solutions should be favored over proprietary alternatives, with exceptions only when no suitable OSS exists or when national security is at risk. The decree also sets a preference hierarchy that prioritizes national and regional OSS solutions to ensure technological sovereignty.


### 🇬🇧 United Kingdom

* 🔗 [Open Source, Open Standards and Re‑Use: Government Action Plan)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a789aade5274a277e68e04d/open_source.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > The UK Government mandates that procurement processes actively consider open-source solutions on equal footing with proprietary alternatives. As detailed in the policy section and reinforced in Action 5, vendors must demonstrate that open-source options were fairly evaluated; failure to do so renders bids non-compliant. Where costs are similar, open-source is preferred for its added flexibility.


### 🇪🇪 Estonia

* 🔗 [Interoperability Framework of the State Information System](https://www.stat.ee/sites/default/files/2022-11/Estonian%20IT%20Interoperability%20Framework%20-%20Abridgement%20of%20Version%203.0.pdf)(https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report%20Estonia%202025.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  >In the "Interoperability Framework of the State Information System," the policy to prioritize open source software in public procurement is detailed across several sections, including "Openness" (2.9), "Technology neutrality" (2.11), and most explicitly in Chapter 6, "Software and open specifications." The framework mandates that public sector institutions must consider open source software alternatives when procuring or developing any new system. More specifically, Requirement 6.1 states a clear preference for software with an accessible source code when other conditions of the procurement are equal. This policy is part of a broader strategy to ensure openness and avoid vendor lock-in, implying that any decision to select a proprietary solution should be well-justified against suitable open source options.

* 📄 Overview:
  >The *Estonian IT Interoperability Framework* mandates that public institutions evaluate open-source software alongside proprietary alternatives in procurement and development. When functional requirements are equal, open-source solutions are to be prioritized, especially because they allow broader reuse across government agencies. The framework also encourages collaborative procurement and requires that IT acquisitions include access to source code or modifications, promoting transparency, long-term sustainability, and avoidance of vendor lock-in.



### 🇫🇷 France

* 📄 Overview:
  >Section 2.3 of the interoperability framework 
 Outlines that public administrations must acquire software based on principles of economy, efficiency, investment protection, reuse, and technological neutrality. This is to be done through a comparative technical and economic assessment of six types of software solutions available on the market: software developed specifically for the public administration (the ""make"" option), reuse of previously developed public sector software, free or open source software, cloud-based software, proprietary software licensed for use, or a combination of these. The ""make"" option involves the public administration commissioning a supplier to develop software—either from scratch or by modifying existing code—based on defined requirements, with the administration potentially handling the analysis and design phases while the supplier executes development and delivery.

* 📄 Overview:
  >In 2005, the Federal IT Strategy Unit (FITSU) published the first version of an OSS strategy for the Federal Administration. At that time, the most important principle was defined as the equal treatment of OSS with closed source software in procurement. Since publication in 2005, the prevalence of open source software has steadily increased. According to the Open Source Study Switzerland 2024 report, a clear majority of companies and authorities use open source software in many different areas. In the software industry, very few companies do not work with open source tools and components. On 1 February 2019, these Strategic Guidelines for Open Source Software in the Federal Administration and the practical guidelines came into force as Version 1.0. With the enact- ment of EMOTA and the new obligations under Article 9, it became necessary to align both sets of guidelines with the new status and create additional tools for the federal authorities."
