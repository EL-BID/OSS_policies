# Prioritize Open Source in Procurement

!!! abstract "About this policy"
      Procurement policies that prioritize or favor open-source software help governments avoid vendor lock-in, reduce long-term costs, and strengthen digital sovereignty. These rules ensure public money supports reusable and adaptable digital infrastructure.
  
!!! note "What we include"
      This section highlights official laws, frameworks, and procurement guidelines that give preference to OSS in public tenders or acquisitions by establishing it as the default option, requiring justification when choosing proprietary software, or including OSS among prioritized alternatives during comparative evaluations.

### 🇧🇷 Brazil

* 🔗 [Law Nº 14.063/2020](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2020/lei/l14063.htm)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Article 16 of Law Nº 14.063/2020 requires public entities to release software they develop under open-source licenses, allowing reuse and modification. This applies retroactively, with exceptions for legal, security, or contractual restrictions.

### 🇨🇦 Canada

* 🔗 [Directive on Management of Information Technology](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603)
* 📄 Overview:
  > "Under the Directive on Management of Information Technology, the Government of Canada (GC) mandates that digital initiatives undergo enterprise architecture assessments to ensure alignment with GC’s digital direction. These assessments, conducted by departmental and enterprise-level Architecture Review Boards, are grounded in the Digital Standards and include a clear preference for OSS where feasible.
 While OSS is encouraged, its acquisition must still comply with applicable procurement laws. If the software is freely available, and the business requirement justifies its use over proprietary alternatives, it may be acquired without a formal tender. However, departments must consult legal services to ensure compliance and properly define contract terms when OSS is acquired through procurement.
 Choosing OSS does not override existing procurement policies. If a contract includes terms that diverge from standard GC policy, the Contracting Authority must seek appropriate exemptions from the Treasury Board or other relevant authorities. This ensures that open source adoption remains both legally sound and strategically aligned with Canada’s broader digital transformation goals."

* 🔗 [National Interoperability Framework of the State Information System](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report%20Estonia%202025.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  >The framework outlines the rules for compliance when public sector institutions are developing information systems. A chapter in the document is dedicated to software and specifications on interoperability and OSS. In the context of the Framework, the public sector must take into consideration alternatives such as open specifications, standards and software: Public sector institutions should follow the principles of openness when developing the architecture of their information systems and procuring software. If a decision is taken to use proprietary software, it must be suitably justified. Furthermore, when procuring software, OSS alternatives must be taken into account."

* 📄 Overview:
  >Central and local government agencies are required to follow a set of principles when using open source software (OSS). In the development of information systems and procurement processes, OSS-based solutions must be evaluated alongside proprietary alternatives. While decisions can favor OSS, commercial software, or a hybrid of both, OSS holds a unique advantage: when requirements are otherwise equal, OSS acquired by one public agency can be freely used and adapted by others—unlike standard proprietary software, which remains under the control of its producer. Collaborative procurement should be prioritized when multiple agencies share similar needs, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, in joint projects or commonly used systems, only products that support open standards and specifications should be employed to ensure interoperability. Agencies must avoid becoming dependent on vendor-specific products and services. When acquiring IT solutions, the procurement should include access to the software’s source code or, in the case of commercial products, any custom adaptations. Where feasible, this principle should be applied to ensure transparency, flexibility, and long-term sustainability in public sector digital infrastructure.

* 📄 Overview:
  > The interoperability framework outlines key principles to guide the development and procurement of public sector information systems, emphasizing openness, technology neutrality, and adaptability. Openness is defined as the willingness of individuals and institutions to share information and engage in dialogue to solve problems. In line with Open Government, Estonia supports public access to government documents and procedures to ensure transparency and accountability. The framework encourages the use of open specifications, standards, and software in public sector IT projects, while acknowledging that closed solutions may be used when they are more mature or efficient, provided such decisions are justified. Technological decisions should focus on functionality rather than specific technologies and should be made transparently and as late as possible in the development process to ensure flexibility. Public procurement must consider free software alternatives and ensure equal treatment of all software solutions, avoiding vendor lock-in. Interfaces for information systems must be designed using open standards such as XML, WSDL, and SOAP to maintain technology neutrality and interoperability.

* 📄 Overview:
  >Section 2.3 of the interoperability framework 
 Outlines that public administrations must acquire software based on principles of economy, efficiency, investment protection, reuse, and technological neutrality. This is to be done through a comparative technical and economic assessment of six types of software solutions available on the market: software developed specifically for the public administration (the ""make"" option), reuse of previously developed public sector software, free or open source software, cloud-based software, proprietary software licensed for use, or a combination of these. The ""make"" option involves the public administration commissioning a supplier to develop software—either from scratch or by modifying existing code—based on defined requirements, with the administration potentially handling the analysis and design phases while the supplier executes development and delivery.

* 📄 Overview:
  >In 2005, the Federal IT Strategy Unit (FITSU) published the first version of an OSS strategy for the Federal Administration. At that time, the most important principle was defined as the equal treatment of OSS with closed source software in procurement. Since publication in 2005, the prevalence of open source software has steadily increased. According to the Open Source Study Switzerland 2024 report, a clear majority of companies and authorities use open source software in many different areas. In the software industry, very few companies do not work with open source tools and components. On 1 February 2019, these Strategic Guidelines for Open Source Software in the Federal Administration and the practical guidelines came into force as Version 1.0. With the enact- ment of EMOTA and the new obligations under Article 9, it became necessary to align both sets of guidelines with the new status and create additional tools for the federal authorities."
