### 🇪🇨 Ecuador

* 🔗 [Organic Code of the Social Economy of Knowledge, Creativity, and Innovation](https://www.gobiernoelectronico.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Codigo-Organico-de-la-Economia-Social-de-los-Conocimientos-Creatividad-e-Innovacion.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > According to Article 148, public entities must follow a strict order of preference when procuring software. This hierarchy prioritizes open-source software, particularly solutions that include significant locally-added value through development or implementation services. If a public body cannot acquire software that meets this top criterion, it is required to formally justify the acquisition of any other type of technology before the national e-government regulatory authority, which will evaluate the decision based on factors such as sustainability, security, and cost.

* 🔗 [Executive Decree No. 1014](https://web.gestiondocumental.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Decreto-Ejecutivo-N-1014.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Executive Decree No. 1014 establishes that entities within Ecuador’s Central Public Administration must prioritize free and open-source software in procurement processes. As outlined in Article 1 and Article 5, open-source solutions should be favored over proprietary alternatives, with exceptions only when no suitable OSS exists or when national security is at risk. The decree also sets a preference hierarchy that prioritizes national and regional OSS solutions to ensure technological sovereignty.

* 📄 Overview:
  >In 2005, the Federal IT Strategy Unit (FITSU) published the first version of an OSS strategy for the Federal Administration. At that time, the most important principle was defined as the equal treatment of OSS with closed source software in procurement. Since publication in 2005, the prevalence of open source software has steadily increased. According to the Open Source Study Switzerland 2024 report, a clear majority of companies and authorities use open source software in many different areas. In the software industry, very few companies do not work with open source tools and components. On 1 February 2019, these Strategic Guidelines for Open Source Software in the Federal Administration and the practical guidelines came into force as Version 1.0. With the enact- ment of EMOTA and the new obligations under Article 9, it became necessary to align both sets of guidelines with the new status and create additional tools for the federal authorities."
