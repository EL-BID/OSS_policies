* 🔗 [Law Nº 14.129/2021](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2021/lei/l14129.htm)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Law Nº 14.129/2021 encourages the creation of innovation laboratories as collaborative spaces between government and society to develop and test new public service solutions. Defined in Article 4, item VIII, these labs promote the use of open and free technologies but do not explicitly establish training or capacity-building programs for OSS adoption or sustainability. While supportive of OSS principles, the law stops short of mandating or funding OSS-specific training efforts.
