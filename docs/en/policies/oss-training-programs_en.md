  >U.S. federal agencies are increasingly embedding open-source software (OSS) training into their development and security practices. CISA promotes a participatory OSS model that encourages contributions and peer review, creating a natural environment for learning-by-doing. Its development of secure-by-design toolkits and memory-safe libraries lays the groundwork for structured educational content. GSA incorporates OSS training through operational practices—requiring teams to perform code scrubbing, licensing checks, and security scans—backed by scripts and documentation that can be adapted into training modules. Meanwhile, 18F offers a robust ecosystem of guides and best practices for onboarding and collaboration, enabling both government teams and external contributors to learn and evolve OSS skills. Together, these efforts form a decentralized but practical approach to OSS capacity building in the U.S. public sector.
