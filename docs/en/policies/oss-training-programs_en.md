# OSS Training Programs

!!! abstract "About this policy"
      Training programs and educational initiatives are essential to building long-term capacity for adopting, maintaining, and contributing to open-source software in the public sector. These policies foster internal knowledge, reduce vendor dependence, and enable sustainable OSS ecosystems.
  
!!! note "What we include"
      This section highlights official training programs, funding schemes, public sector workshops, online courses, and related efforts that promote the development of OSS skills among civil servants, developers, and government partners.

### 🇧🇷 Brazil

* 🔗 [Law Nº 14.129/2021](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2021/lei/l14129.htm)
* 📄 Overview:
  > Law Nº 14.129/2021 encourages the creation of innovation laboratories as collaborative spaces between government and society to develop and test new public service solutions. Defined in Article 4, item VIII, these labs promote the use of open and free technologies but do not explicitly establish training or capacity-building programs for OSS adoption or sustainability. While supportive of OSS principles, the law stops short of mandating or funding OSS-specific training efforts.

* 📄 Overview:
  >U.S. federal agencies are increasingly embedding open-source software (OSS) training into their development and security practices. CISA promotes a participatory OSS model that encourages contributions and peer review, creating a natural environment for learning-by-doing. Its development of secure-by-design toolkits and memory-safe libraries lays the groundwork for structured educational content. GSA incorporates OSS training through operational practices—requiring teams to perform code scrubbing, licensing checks, and security scans—backed by scripts and documentation that can be adapted into training modules. Meanwhile, 18F offers a robust ecosystem of guides and best practices for onboarding and collaboration, enabling both government teams and external contributors to learn and evolve OSS skills. Together, these efforts form a decentralized but practical approach to OSS capacity building in the U.S. public sector.
