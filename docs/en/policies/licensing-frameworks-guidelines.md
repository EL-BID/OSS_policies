They help standardize how public institutions manage intellectual property, clarify reuse rights, and reduce legal uncertainties across jurisdictions.
  
!!! note "What we include"
      This section includes official frameworks, licensing guides, decrees, and strategic recommendations that define which licenses can be used by public sector entities, how to select them, and under what conditions software must be made available under open-source terms.

      
### 🌍  Policies

### 🇨🇦 Canada

* 🔗 [Guide for Publishing Open Source Code](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/open-source-software/guide-for-publishing-open-source-code.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> The Guide for Publishing Open Source Code outlines licensing best practices for government OSS projects, recommending permissive (MIT, Apache 2.0) or reciprocal (GPL, LGPL, AGPL) licenses based on project needs. It advises selecting licenses aligned with community norms and ensuring compatibility with third-party components to enable compliant and effective open-source release.

* 🔗 [Open Source Software Form](https://code.open.canada.ca/en/open-source-software-form.html)
* 📄 Overview:
> The Open Source Software Form provides guidance for Canadian public administrations to register OSS projects along with their licensing information using standardized SPDX identifiers. By requiring submission of license details including short identifiers, URLs, and license levels, this process promotes consistency and legal clarity in how open-source software is shared and reused across jurisdictions. The use of SPDX ensures alignment with internationally recognized licensing practices for software, data, and related assets.

### 🇨🇴 Colombia

* 🔗 [Digital Government Manual: Implementation of the Digital Government Policy](https://gobiernodigital.mintic.gov.co/692/articles-79394_recurso_1.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
> The manual provides clear guidance on software licensing, as outlined in Section 3.2 under the principle of "Apertura" (Openness). It explicitly recommends that public entities prioritize software with open source licenses. This guideline is established to facilitate the subsequent publication and cost-free reuse of government-developed software solutions, aligning with the policy's transparency goals.

* 🔗 [Licensing of State-Owned Software Source Code to Public Entities (Resolution 537 of 2018)](https://normograma.mintic.gov.co/mintic/compilacion/docs/resolucion_mintic_0537_2018.htm)
* 📄 Overview:
> This resolution itself acts as a specific licensing guideline for public software. Article 1 grants a bespoke license to public entities, defining the specific rights of reproduction, public communication, transformation, and distribution. Article 4 adds a mandatory share-alike clause for derivative works, creating a clear legal framework for inter-agency software reuse.

### 🇪🇪 Estonia

* 🔗 [Interoperability Framework of the State Information System](https://www.stat.ee/sites/default/files/2022-11/Estonian%20IT%20Interoperability%20Framework%20-%20Abridgement%20of%20Version%203.0.pdf)
* 📄 Overview:
> The "Interoperability Framework of the State Information System" provides specific guidelines on licensing practices for software developed or procured by the Estonian public sector. The central policy, found in Requirement 2.37 under the principle of "Reusability," directs public institutions to use the European Union Public Licence (EUPL) when creating and releasing free software. This guidance is reinforced in Chapter 6, which recommends that custom software code procured by the government also be registered in a repository under a free software license, again citing the EUPL as the example. The framework further advises that procurement contracts should ensure the resulting software is usable without restriction across other public administration institutions, thereby establishing a clear preference for licenses that permit broad inter-agency sharing and reuse.

### 🇫🇷 France

* 🔗 [Legal Guide for Open Source Software – Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/accompagnement-logiciels-libres/)

> This policy mandates the use of open standards to ensure interoperability across all software acquired by public administrations. As specified in the assessment criteria outlined in **Section 2.3.2**, all potential software solutions—whether open source or proprietary—must be evaluated on their use of open data formats, open interfaces (including APIs), and established interoperability standards. This requirement is reinforced in **Section 2.6.1**, which stipulates that even proprietary software is only eligible for consideration if it allows for complete data export in a standard, open, and documented format to prevent vendor lock-in.
