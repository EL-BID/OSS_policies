# 🌐 Open Source Policy Collection

Welcome to our curated repository of public policies on open source software. This collection was developed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to support learning and comparative analysis of government approaches to open source around the world.

This project aims to **collect, organize, and document public policies** related to open source software from governments worldwide. By categorizing policies by their **purpose and approach** we hope to facilitate:

- **🧠 Policy Learning**: Understanding different approaches to open source governance  
- **🌟 Best Practice Sharing**: Identifying successful policy implementations  
- **🌐 Global Collaboration**: Connecting policymakers working on similar challenges

## 🧭 Structure

Policies are categorized by **policy type**, not by country. Each linked page includes:
- A short explanation of the policy type
- Key features or innovations
- A link to the official government source (when available)
