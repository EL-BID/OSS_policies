# 🌐 Open-Source Policy Collection

To support Latin American and Caribbean countries in shaping their strategies for open-source software adoption, **[Code for Development](https://knowledge.iadb.org/en/code-development)**, the Inter-American Development Bank’s open-source initiative, has created this repository of public policies from governments around the world. 

The collection brings together regulations, policy documents, and strategic frameworks from various jurisdictions, serving as a reference for policymakers, technologists, and public officials exploring open-source-first approaches in government. 

By organizing these policies according to   their purpose and focus, this resource aims to facilitate: 

- **🧠 Policy Learning:** Understanding different approaches to open-source governance  
- **🌟 Best Practice Sharing:** Highlighting successful implementations that can inspire others 
- **🌐 Global Collaboration:** Connecting policymakers working toward similar goals

## 🧭 Structure

The open-source policies featured in this site are organized in two complementary ways:

**By Policy Category:**  
  Policies are grouped by type (e.g., public release of software, reuse, licensing, training) to showcase thematic approaches and implementation patterns. Each category page includes:
  
  - A short explanation of the policy type  
  - A list of official documents or strategies  
  - Links to the original sources  
  - Policy overviews  

**By Country:**  
  For users interested in national approaches, the [country view](policies/complete-country-overview_en.md) presents all documented policies grouped by jurisdiction. This view helps highlight how different countries address multiple aspects of open-source governance in a single place.

> **Note:** For the **European Commission**, we have grouped all regional policies under a single entry due to their wide applicability across member states.

**📢 Share Your Experience**

In addition to contributing policy documents, we invite governments and organizations to take part in the **[Global Open-Source Policies & Practices Survey](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/opensourcesurvey)**, launched by the Digital Public Goods Alliance Secretariat together with twenty-four partner institutions. By completing the survey, you will help map the global landscape of open-source policies and practices, surface challenges, and highlight promising approaches. Your participation will enrich this repository and support the collective effort to advance open-source-first adoption worldwide
