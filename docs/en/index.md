# Open Source Policy Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation site for public policies on open source software. This site organizes policies by **type** rather than by country, making it easier to understand different approaches to open source governance across the globe.

## 🎯 Mission

This project aims to collect, organize, and document public policies related to open source software from governments worldwide. By categorizing policies by their purpose and approach rather than geography, we hope to facilitate:

- **Policy Learning**: Understanding different approaches to open source governance
- **Best Practice Sharing**: Identifying successful policy implementations
- **Global Collaboration**: Connecting policymakers working on similar challenges

## 📋 Policy Categories

We organize policies into the following categories:

### 🏛️ Government Software Management
- **Public Release of State-Owned Software**: Policies requiring government-developed software to be made publicly available
- **Reuse and Transfer of Government Software**: Guidelines for sharing software between government agencies
- **Open Source Sharing Platforms**: Establishment of platforms for government open source collaboration

### 💰 Procurement and Economic Policy
- **Prioritize Open Source in Procurement**: Policies giving preference to open source solutions in government purchasing
- **OSS Funding and Support Programs**: Government programs that financially support open source projects
- **Licensing Frameworks and Guidelines**: Official guidance on open source licensing for government use

### 🛡️ Security and Standards
- **Open Source Security Measures**: Policies addressing security considerations in open source adoption
- **Open Standards Requirement**: Mandates for using open standards in government systems
- **OSS in Critical Infrastructure**: Specific policies for open source use in critical systems

### 📚 Capacity Building and Strategy
- **OSS Training Programs**: Government initiatives to build open source skills
- **OSS in Strategic Planning Documents**: Integration of open source considerations into national digital strategies
- **Mandatory Contribution Back to OSS**: Requirements for government agencies to contribute to open source projects
