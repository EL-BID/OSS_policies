# Contributing to Open Source Policy Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open source software policy documentation project! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project aims to:
- Document public policies related to open source software from governments worldwide
- Organize policies by type rather than geography to facilitate learning and comparison
- Provide a multilingual resource for policymakers, researchers, and advocates
- Enable easy discovery of policy approaches and best practices

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### 1. Adding New Countries to Existing Policies

Each policy page includes a template for adding new countries. Simply:

1. Navigate to the relevant policy page (e.g., "Public Release of State-Owned Software")
2. Copy the contribution template provided on the page
3. Replace the example information with accurate details about your country's policy
4. Include official links and authentic policy excerpts
5. Submit a pull request

### 2. Adding New Policy Types

If you've identified a policy type not currently covered:

1. Open an issue describing the new policy type
2. Provide examples from at least 2-3 countries
3. Suggest a clear, descriptive name for the policy category
4. Wait for discussion and approval before creating new pages

### 3. Improving Translations

We welcome improvements to existing translations or translations for new languages:

1. Check the current language support (English, Spanish, Portuguese)
2. For new languages, open an issue to discuss implementation
3. For improvements, submit pull requests with corrected translations
4. Maintain consistency with the existing structure and formatting
